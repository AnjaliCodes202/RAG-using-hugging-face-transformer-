Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data.
Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are major categories of machine learning.
Algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks are commonly used.
Machine learning applications include image recognition, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.
