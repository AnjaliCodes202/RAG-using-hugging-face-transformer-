Large Language Models (LLMs) are neural networks trained on massive amounts of text data.
They learn patterns in language and can generate human-like text responses.
However, LLMs may produce incorrect or outdated information because they rely on static training data.
To improve reliability, external tools and retrieval mechanisms can be integrated with LLMs.
