Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with large language models.
Instead of relying only on the model’s internal knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant documents from an external source.
These retrieved documents are then provided as context to the language model to generate accurate and grounded answers.
RAG is widely used to reduce hallucinations and improve factual correctness in domain-specific applications.
